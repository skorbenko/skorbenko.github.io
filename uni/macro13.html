<li>Fiscal Policy: the Basics<ul>
<li>Taxes, Purchases of G&amp;S, Government Transfers, and Borrowing<ul>
<li>Circular flow of income and spending in the whole economy. One of the sectors is gvt</li>
<li>U.S. government spending takes two broad forms. One form is purchases of goods and services. The other form of government spending is government transfers, which are payments by the government to households for which no good or service is provided in return.</li>
<li>Most US government spending is three big programs<ul>
<li>Social Security: guaranteed income to older and disabled americans, dependents</li>
<li>Medicare: healthcare for over 65</li>
<li>Medicaid: low income healthcare</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Government Budget and Total Spending<ul>
<li>$$GDP=C+I+G+X-IM$$</li>
<li>Government controls $$G$$, but it is not the only influence: also $$C$$ and $$I$$<ul>
<li>Why $$C$$: disposable income is reduced by an increase in taxes or a reduction in government transfers; a fall in disposable income leads to a fall of consumer spending</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expansionary and Contractionary Policy<ul>
<li>$$SRAS$$: short-run aggregate supply curve</li>
<li>$$LRAS$$: long-run aggregate supply curve</li>
<li>$$AD_1$$: initial aggregate demand curve</li>
<li>$$E_1$$: initial short-run economic equilibrium</li>
<li>$$Y_1$$: aggregate yield (output)</li>
<li>$$Y_p$$: potential yield (output)</li>
<li><strong>Expansionary fiscal policy </strong>is one that <strong>increases </strong>aggregate demand and shifts it rightward<ul>
<li>An increase in government purchases of goods and services</li>
<li>A cut in taxes</li>
<li>An increase in government transfers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Contractionary fiscal policy </strong>is one that <strong>reduces </strong>aggregate demand and shifts it leftward</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can Expansionary Fiscal Policy Actually Work?<ul>
<li>3 arguments against the use of expansionary fiscal policy: (all wrong)<ul>
<li>Government spending always crowds out private spending</li>
<li>Government borrowing always crowds out private investment spending</li>
<li>Government budget deficits lead to reduced private spending</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Cautionary Note: Lags in Fiscal Policy<ul>
<li>Must not be used too often -- be cautious<ul>
<li>Time lags between the the time when the policy is decided upon and when the effects actually come into fruition</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fiscal Policy and the Multiplier<ul>
<li>Multiplier Effects of an Increase in Government Purchases of Goods and Services<ul>
<li>the multiplier is the ratio of the change in real GDP caused by an autonomous change in aggregate spending to the size of that autonomous change. </li>
<li>Firms that produce the goods and services purchased by the government earn revenues that flow to households in the form of wages, profits, interest, and rent. This increase in disposable income leads to a rise in consumer spending. The rise in consumer spending, in turn, induces firms to increase output, leading to a further rise in disposable income, which leads to another round of consumer spending increases, and so on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiplier Effects of Changes in Government Transfers and Taxes<ul>
<li>Not only purchases of G&amp;S but also transfer payments and taxes</li>
<li>Government payments and Taxes have no multiplier</li>
<li>A tax cut has an effect similar to the effect of a transfer as it increases disposable income, but governments rarely impose lump-sum taxes.</li>
<li>Non-lump-sum taxes reduce the size of the multiplier</li>
<li>Economists think that the size of the multiplier determines <strong>who</strong> gets the tax cuts or increases in gvt transmers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How Taxes Affect the Multiplier<ul>
<li>If real GDP increases by $1, disposable income increases by less than $1 after taxes</li>
<li>This is not deliberate as gvt revenue grows automatically when real GP goes up</li>
<li>These taxes reduce the size of the multiplier</li>
<li>Remember, the multiplier is the result of a chain reaction in which higher real GDP leads to higher disposable income, which leads to higher consumer spending, which leads to further increases in real GDP.</li>
<li>Government spending and taxation rules that cause fiscal policy to be automatically expansionary when the economy contracts and automatically contractionary when the economy expands, without requiring any deliberate action by policy makers, are called <strong>automatic stabilizers</strong>.</li>
<li>Some types of government transfers also play a stabilizing role. For example, more people receive unemployment insurance when the economy is depressed than when it is booming.</li>
<li>As in the case of government tax revenue, many macroeconomists believe that it’s a good thing that government transfers reduce the multiplier. Expansionary and contractionary fiscal policies that are the result of automatic stabilizers are widely considered helpful to macroeconomic stabilization because they blunt the extremes of the business cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Discretionary fiscal policy</strong> is fiscal policy that is the result of deliberate actions by policy makers rather than automatic adjustment. </li>
<li>During a recession, the government may pass legislation that cuts taxes and 
increases government spending in order to stimulate the economy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Budget Balance<ul>
<li>The Budget Balance as a Measure of Fiscal Policy<ul>
<li>$$S_g=T-G-TR$$<ul>
<li>$$T$$ is the tax revenue</li>
<li>$$G$$ is the government purchases of G&amp;S</li>
<li>$$TR$$ is the value of government transfers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expansionary fiscal policies decrease the budget for the year</li>
<li>There are two reasons why measuring fiscal policy by the changes in the budget balance is misleading<ul>
<li>Two different changes in fiscal policy that have equal-sized effects on the 
budget balance may have quite unequal effects on the economy. As we have already seen, changes in government purchases of goods and services have a larger effect on real GDP than equal-sized changes in taxes and government 
transfers.</li>
<li>Often, changes in the budget balance are themselves the result, not the cause, of fluctuations in the economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Business Cycle and the Cyclically Adjusted Budget Balance<ul>
<li>Historically there has been a strong relationship between the federal government’s budget balance and the business cycle. </li>
<li>The cyclically adjusted budget balance is an estimate of what the budget balance would be if real GDP were exactly equal to potential output. It takes into account the extra tax revenue the government would collect and the transfers it would save if a recessionary gap were eliminated—or the revenue the government would lose and the extra transfers it would make if an inflationary gap were eliminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should the Budget Be Balanced?<ul>
<li>Budget deficits can also cause problems, but politicians are tempted to run these deficits to cater to voters</li>
<li>A budget should not be balanced every year? No. The budget should only be balanced <strong>on average</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Long-Run Implications of Fiscal Policy<ul>
<li>Deficits, Surpluses, and Debt<ul>
<li>Budget totals are kept by <strong>fiscal years</strong>, which run from October 1 to September 30 and are labeled by the calendar year in which they end.</li>
<li>A government that runs persistent budget deficits will experience a rising level of <strong>public debt</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems Posed by Rising Government Debt<ul>
<li>Two reasons to be concerned when a government runs persistent budget deficits<ul>
<li>Crowding out<ul>
<li>When the economy is at full employment and the government borrows funds in the financial markets, it is competing with firms that plan to borrow funds for investment spending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Today’s deficits place pressure on future budgets by increasing the debt<ul>
<li>Other things equal, a government paying large sums in interest must raise more revenue from taxes or spend less than it would otherwise be able to afford— or it must borrow even more to cover the gap. And a government that borrows to pay interest on its outstanding debt pushes itself even deeper into debt</li>
<li>Possibility of a default</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deficits and Debt in Practice<ul>
<li><strong>Debt-GDP ratio</strong> is used to assess the ability of governments to pay their debts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implicit Liabilities <ul>
<li><strong>Implicit liabilities</strong> are spending promises made by governments that are effectively a debt despite the fact that they are not included in the usual debt statistics.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated taxes</strong>: expenses are paid out of special taxes on wages</li>
