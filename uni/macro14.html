<h1>C14: Money, Banking, and the Federal Reserve System</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Meaning of Money<ul>
<li>What is Money?<ul>
<li>Money is any asset that can easily be used to purchase goods and services.</li>
<li>An asset is liquid if it can easily be converted into cash. Money <strong>is</strong> cash</li>
<li>A bank account is money. Currency in circulation and checkable bank deposits are both money.</li>
<li>Two definitions of money supply:<ul>
<li>The narrower definition considers only the most liquid assets to be money: currency in circulation, traveler’s checks, and checkable bank deposits. </li>
<li>The broader definition includes these three categories plus other assets that are “almost” checkable, such as savings account deposits that can be transferred into a checking account with a phone call or a mouse click. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Money is useful because it makes indirect exchange possible -- gains from trade</li>
<li>The problem of finding a double coincidence of wants: in barter, both parties must have something the other party wants. Money solves this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roles of Money<ul>
<li>Medium of Exchange</li>
<li>Store of Value</li>
<li>Unit of Account</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of Money<ul>
<li><strong>Commodity </strong>money: gold or silver that had intrinsic value in other uses.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity-backed </strong>money: a medium of exchange with no intrinsic value that is guaranteed by a promise that it can be converted into valuable goods.</li>
<li><strong>Fiat</strong> money is one whose value derives entirely from its  status as a means of exchange is known as fiat money because it exists by government fiat, a historical term for a policy declared by a ruler.<ul>
<li>Two major advantages<ul>
<li>Creating it does not cost anything</li>
<li>Supply can be regulated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risks<ul>
<li>Counterfeiters can usurp the privilege of the government</li>
<li>Governments can create money whenever they want; they can abuse their privileges</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Measuring the Money Supply: M1 and M2<ul>
<li>M1 counts only currency in circulation, checks, and checkable bank deposits</li>
<li>M2 adds near-moneys: time deposits, savings deposi</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Monetary Role of Banks<ul>
<li>What Banks Do<ul>
<li>a Bank is a financial intermediary that uses liquid assets in the form of bank deposits to finance the illiquid investments of borrowers. Banks create liquidity except in the case of a bank run.</li>
<li>Banks cannot lend out all the depositors&#39; funds because they must be able to offer withdrawals. <strong>Bank reserves</strong> are kept at the Federal Reserve</li>
<li>A <strong>T-account</strong> summarizes financial position by showing the business’s assets and liabilities, with assets on the left and liabilities on the right.</li>
<li>A <strong>reserve ratio</strong> is the fraction of bank deposits that a bank holds as reserves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Problem of Bank Runs<ul>
<li>A bank run is a phenomenon in which many of a bank’s depositors try to withdraw their funds due to fears of a bank failure.</li>
<li>Bank runs have proved to be contagious throughout history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bank Regulation<ul>
<li>Deposit Insurance<ul>
<li>Almost all US banks are members of the FDIC -- the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</li>
<li>The FDIC guarantees the first $250k per depositor per insured bank</li>
<li>Since depositors think their money is safe even if a bank fails, they have no need for a bank run</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Capital Requirements<ul>
<li>Deposit Insurance allows risky bank behavior to go undetected. At the same time, bank owners are risky since they are protected from loss.</li>
<li>Capital must be at least 7% of the value of assets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reserve Requirements<ul>
<li>In the US, the minimum reserve ratio for checkable bank deposits is 10%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discount Window<ul>
<li>The Federal Reserve can lend money to banks in trouble, so no selling at discount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determining the Money Supply<ul>
<li>Banks remove currency from circulation, decreasing money supply</li>
<li>Banks create money by accepting deposits &amp; making loans, increasing money supply.</li>
<li>How Banks Create Money<ul>
<li>{{[[TODO]]}} <strong>Multiplier process</strong></li>
<li>{{[[TODO]]}} <strong>Money multiplier</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reserves, Bank Deposits, and the Money Multiplier<ul>
<li>Assumptions<ul>
<li>Banks have a minimum reserve ratio of 10%</li>
<li>Every banks lends out all of its excess reserves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculations<ul>
<li>$1,000 + $900 + $810 + $729 + . . .</li>
<li>Increase in checkable bank deposits from $1,000 in excess reserves = $1,000 + ($1,000 × (1 − rr)) + ($1,000 × (1 − rr)2) + ($1,000 × (1 − rr)3) + . . .</li>
<li>Increase in checkable bank deposits from $1,000 in excess reserves = $1,000/rr</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the reserve ratio is 10%, each $1 of reserves held by a bank supports $1/rr = $1/0.1 = $10 of checkable bank deposits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Money Multiplier in Reality<ul>
<li>The Fed controls the <strong>sum of bank reserves</strong> and <strong>currency in circulation</strong>, the monetary base, but it does not control the allocation of that sum between bank reserves and currency in circulation.</li>
<li>Example: by taking the cash from under one&#39;s bed and depositing it in a bank, one reduced the quantity of currency in circulation but increased bank reserves by an equal amount—leaving the monetary base, on net, unchanged. </li>
<li>The monetary base differs from the money supply in two ways<ul>
<li>Bank reserves are not part of the money supply</li>
<li>Checkable bank deposits are not part of monetary base</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Money Multiplier</strong> is the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve System<ul>
<li>Structure of the Fed<ul>
<li>The Federal Reserve (1913) is not a part of the US government, but it is not a private institution either.</li>
<li>Two parts: the Board of Governors and the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks</li>
<li>Board of Governors<ul>
<li>Constituted like a government agency</li>
<li>Seven members; appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate</li>
<li>14-year terms to decrease political pressure</li>
<li>Chairs are appointed for four years, but are often reappointed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>12 Federal Reserve Banks<ul>
<li>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York carries out <strong>open-market operations</strong>, the main tool of monetary policy.</li>
<li>Decisions on monetary policy are made by the Federal Open Market Committee -- the Board of Governors + five regional bank presidents; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is always on the committee. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What the Fed Does: Reserve Requirements and the Discount Rate<ul>
<li>Three main policy tools<ul>
<li>Reserve Requirements</li>
<li>Discount Rate</li>
<li>Open-Market Operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a bank has insufficient reserve, it borrows from other banks that are holding excess reserves via the <strong>federal funds market</strong>. The interest rate in this market is determined by supply and demand. The supply and demand are strongly affected by Federal Reserve actions. </li>
<li>The <strong>federal funds rate</strong> is the interst rate at which funds are borrowed and lent in the <strong>federal funds market</strong> plays a key role in modern monetary policy.</li>
<li>Banks can also borrow from the Fed itself via the discount window. The <strong>discount rate</strong> is the rate of interest that the Fed charges on these loans. It is usually 1% more than the <strong>federal funds rate</strong></li>
<li>Open-Market Operations<ul>
<li><strong>Open-Market Operations</strong> is a transaction with commercial banks (banks that mainly make business, not home. loans) to buy or sell US Treasury bills. The Fed never buys Treasure bills from the US government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The European Central Bank<ul>
<li>The European Central Bank is the only CB that rivals the Fed in terms of importance.</li>
<li>Created in 1999, located in Frankfurt</li>
<li>It is not private but also not  agovernment agency -- there is no pan-European government</li>
<li>The European counterparts of the regional Federal Reserve Banks are Europe’s national central banks: the Bank of France, the Bank of Italy</li>
</ul>

<li>The Crisis in American Banking in the Early Twentieth Century<ul>
<li>From 1864 until 1913, American banking was dominated by a federalyl regulated system of national banks.</li>
<li>The problem was that the money supply was not sufficiently responsive.</li>
<li>Panic of 1907 (see Wikipedia)</li>
<li>Responding to Banking Crises: the Creation of the Federal Reserve<ul>
<li>An investment bank trades in financial assets and is not covered by deposit insurance.</li>
<li>A commercial bank accepts deposits and is covered by deposit insurance</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>The Savings and Loan Crisis of the 1980s<ul>
<li>A <strong>Savings and Loan</strong> is a deposit-taking abnk that is specialized in issuing long-term mortgages. They were tightly regulated but did not work with high inflation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Back to the Future: The Financial Crisis of 2008<ul>
<li>Long-Term Capital Management was a hedge fund. It was virtually unregulated and use vast amounts of leverage. </li>
<li>The <strong>balance sheet effect</strong> is the reduction in a firm’s net worth due to falling asset prices.</li>
<li>A <strong>vicious cycle of deleveraging</strong>takes place when asset sales to cover losses produce negative balance sheet effects on other firms and force creditors to call in their loans, forcing sales of more assets and causing further declines in asset prices.</li>
<li><strong>Subprime lending</strong> is lending to home-buyers who don’t meet the usual criteria for being able to afford their payments.</li>
<li><strong>Securitization</strong>: when financial institutions asssemble pools of laons and sell shares in the income from theses pools.</li>
<li>The <strong>TED spread</strong> is the difference between the interest rate at which banks lend to each other and the interest rate on U.S. government debt.</li>
