<li>Short-term interest rates are the interest rates on financial assets that mature within less than a year.</li>
<li>Long-term interest rates are interest rates on financial assets that mature a number of years in the future.</li>
<li>Individuals and firms find it useful to hold some of their assets in the form of money because of the convenience money provides: money can be used to make purchases directly, but other assets can’t. But there is a price to be paid for that convenience: money normally yields a lower rate of return than nonmonetary assets.</li>
<li>The higher the short-term interest rate, the higher the opportunity cost of holding money; the lower the short-term interest rate, the lower the opportunity cost of holding money.</li>
<li>At any given moment, long-term interest rates—rates of interest on financial assets that mature, or come due, a number of years into the future—may be different from short-term interest rates</li>
