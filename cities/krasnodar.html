<h1 id="krasnodar">Krasnodar</h1>
<p>Krasnodar made a contradictory impression on me. On the one hand, one experiences uncanny urban planning that struck me so much that I could not think of anything else in my thoughts on the city.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one feels the political sense of the city – those with an above-average income have political connections with the administration of the city or the region even if they haven’t lived there for too long.</p>
<p>But I had an interesting time in Krasnodar. Due to the centralization of Russian financial flows and the COVID closed borders, it becomes so that Muscovites, as the least affected by the pandemic and the most tired from business matters, leave for other constituent entities of the Russian Federation for a couple of days and inject money into these entities. At the start of the pandemic, Krasnodar was ready for this - a favorable climate, worthy restaurants and bars, attractions. Krasnodar is the city closest to St. Petersburg in terms of the quality of recreation for a Moscow tourist for two or three days.</p>
<p>However, I must also visit Yekaterinburg – maybe it will beat out Krasnodar. Krasnodar, thank you!</p>
<p>Thank you S, G, M for your tips and for your help in Krasnodar.</p>
