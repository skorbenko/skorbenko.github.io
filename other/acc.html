<li>Advantages of Single-Step vs. Multistep<ul>
<li>Simple-step is simple</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>L6: Measuring Business Income<ul>
<li>Profitability<ul>
<li>is the ability to earn enough income to attract and hold investment capital</li>
<li>Accountants use the term <strong>net income</strong>, not <strong>profit</strong></li>
<li>Net Income = Revenues - Expenses<ul>
<li>is the increase in owner&#39;s equity that results from the operations of a company</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revenues<ul>
<li>Increases in owner&#39;s equity resulting from<ul>
<li>Selling goods</li>
<li>Rendering services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not all increases in equity arise from revenues<ul>
<li>Increases from owner&#39;s investments do not represent revenue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a company earns revenue, it usually receives cash or a promise to be paid (Accounts Receivable or Notes Receivable)</li>
<li>Liabilities are not affected by revenues</li>
<li>Transactions increase cash or assets <strong>but</strong> are not revenues<ul>
<li>A bank loan: increases liabilties and cash</li>
<li>Collection of accounts receivable: increases cash and decreases accounts receivable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expenses<ul>
<li>Decreases in owner&#39;s equity resulting from costs<ul>
<li>Selling goods</li>
<li>Rendering services</li>
<li>Also called the cost of doing business</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transactions that decrease cash and other assets but are not expenses<ul>
<li>Cash payments to reduce liabilities: decrease cash and decrease liabilities</li>
<li>Owner withdrawals<ul>
<li>Decrease cash and decrease owner&#39;s equity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prepaid Expenses and Plant Assets<ul>
<li>Two steps before an expenditure of cash becomes an expense<ul>
<li>Prepaid expenses and plant asseys are recorded as assets when acquired</li>
<li>Cost allocated to expenses as usefulness expires</li>
<li>Expenses are also called expired costs</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Income Measurement Issues<ul>
<li>Accounting period issue (Periodicity)<ul>
<li>Concerns the difficulty of assigning revenues and expenses to a short period of time</li>
<li>Problem: some transactions have effects over long periods of time</li>
<li>Solution: make an assumption about periodicty</li>
<li>Accounting Period<ul>
<li>A specific length of time during which results of transactions are recorded &amp; measured</li>
<li>Time periods of equal length</li>
<li>Financial statements may be prepared for any time period</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal year</strong><ul>
<li>Twelve-month accounting period used by orgs</li>
<li>Should always be noted in the financial statements</li>
<li>Business can use calendar year or the annual business cycle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interim period<ul>
<li>Accounting of less than a year</li>
<li>A month or a quarter</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continuity issue<ul>
<li>Difficulty of knowing how long a business wil survive</li>
<li>Problem: certain revenue and expense transactions must be allocated over several accounting periods; uncertainty over the future</li>
<li>Solution: accountant assumes that the business operates indefinitely</li>
<li>Assumption of Continuity<ul>
<li>Cost of assets can be held until a future year when they will becom expenses</li>
<li>Value of assets is recorded at cost and does not change<ul>
<li>When facing bankruptcy, there is no assumption of continuity: assets may be reported at liquidation value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Matching issue<ul>
<li>Problem: Revenues can be earned in a period other than the one in which cash is received; expenses can be incurred in a period other than the one in which cash is paid.</li>
<li>Solution: Assign revenues to accounting period in which goods are sold or services are rendered; assign expenses to the period when they are used to produce income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accrual Accounting<ul>
<li>is the attempt to record financial effects of transactions in the periods in which they occur rather than when cash is received or paid</li>
<li>Revenue Recognition<ul>
<li>The process of determining when revenue is earned and when it should be recorded</li>
<li>Four criteria for revenue recognition<ul>
<li>Persuasive evidence of an agreement</li>
<li>Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered</li>
<li>The seller&#39;s price to the buyer is fiexed or determinable</li>
<li>Reasonable assurance that amount is collectable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expense Recognition<ul>
<li>Same criteria as for revenue recognition</li>
<li>Criteria for recognizing expenses<ul>
<li>An agreement exists to purchase a product or service</li>
<li>The product has been delivered or services rendered</li>
<li>A price is established or can be determined</li>
<li>The product has been used to produce revenue</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusting the Accounts<ul>
<li>Operating a business is a continuous process, but there must be a cutoff point for periodic reports<ul>
<li>Reports are prepared at the end of accounting period<ul>
<li>Balance sheet must list all assets and liabilities at the end</li>
<li>Income statement must list all revenues and expenses of accounting period</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some transactions span more than one accounting period; these transactions require adjustments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accrual Accounting and Performance Measures<ul>
<li>Importance of adjustments<ul>
<li>Necessary for determining key profitability performance measures because affects:</li>
<li>Net income on the income statement<ul>
<li>Profitability comparisons of different period</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assets and liabilities on the balance sheet<ul>
<li>Provide information about a company’s future cash inflows and outflows</li>
<li>Information needed to assess management’s short-term goal of liquidity so that there is enough cash to pay bills</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusting Entries<ul>
<li>Never after the Cash account</li>
<li>-- never affect cash flows after the current period, but provides information about future cash flows<ul>
<li>Accounts Receivable: expected future cash inflows</li>
<li>Accounts Payable: expected future cash outflows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Considerable judgement in adjusting entries -- potential for abuse; misuse can result in misleading performance measures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjustment’s Effect on the Income Statement and Balance Sheet ^^<strong>Slide 34</strong>^^</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjustment Process<ul>
<li>Adjusting Entries are used to apply accrual accounting to transactions that span more than one accounting period</li>
<li>Each adjusting entry must include at least:<ul>
<li>1 balance sheet account</li>
<li>1 income statement account</li>
<li>No Cash account</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusting entries are required when<ul>
<li>Recorded costs are allocated between two or more accounting periods</li>
<li>Expenses are incurred but not recorded</li>
<li>Recorded but unearned revenues are allocated between two or more accounting periods</li>
<li>Revenues are earned but not recorded</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Four Types of Adjustments ^^<strong>Slide 39</strong>^^<ul>
<li>Deferred Expenses -- recorded costs are allocated between two or more accounting periods</li>
<li>Accrued Expenses -- expenses are incurred but not recorded</li>
<li>Accrued Revenues -- revenues are earned but not recorded</li>
<li>Deferred Revenues -- revenues are recorded but unearned and two or more accounting periods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deferrals -- postponements of either<ul>
<li>A recognition of a revenue paid in advance (type 3)</li>
<li>A recognition of a paid expense (type 1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accruals<ul>
<li>An expense that happened but has not yet been recorded (type 2)<ul>
<li>Cash will be paid in future</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A revenue that happened but has not been recorded (type 4)<ul>
<li>Cash will be received in future</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deferred Expenses<ul>
<li>Postponement of recognition of expenses already paid</li>
<li>Require allocating recorded costs between two or more periods<ul>
<li>Recorded costs<ul>
<li>Expenditures of &gt;1 accounting period</li>
<li>Debited to asset account</li>
<li>End of accounting period the used amount will be transferred to expense account<ul>
<li>Prepaid expenses and depreciation of
plant and equipment are two types of adjustments involving deferred expenses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prepaid Expenses<ul>
<li>Expenses paid in advance but that have not expired are recorded as assets</li>
<li>A certain portion expires at the end of accounting period</li>
<li>Adjusting entry reduces assets and increases expense<ul>
<li>Amount of adjustment is the cost of goods/services that are used up/expired</li>
<li>If adjustments of prepaid expenses are not made,<ul>
<li>Assets will be overstated</li>
<li>Expenses will be understated</li>
<li>Equity will be overstated</li>
<li>Net income will be overstated</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>^^<strong>EXAMPLES: Slide 48-56</strong>^^</li>
<li>Depreciation<ul>
<li>is the periodic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its estimated useful life<ul>
<li>Purchase of Long-term asset = company is paying in advance for the usefulness of asset for as long as it benefits the company</li>
<li>Purchase of an asset is a deferral of an expense; Cost of asset is allocated over its useful life</li>
<li>The amount allocated to any one period is called <strong>depreciation</strong>, or <strong>depreciation expense</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>is an expense that is incurred to produce revenue; it must be estimated:<ul>
<li>Useful life of asset is estimated</li>
<li>Cost and useful life used to determine the amount expensed each month</li>
<li>A number of methods exist for this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Depreciation expense does not reduce the asset account directly; is recorded in a <strong>contra account</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contra account<ul>
<li>A separate account paired with asset account</li>
<li>Used to show the accumulated amount of depreciation expensed for the asset</li>
<li>Balance in contra account is show on financial statements as a deduction from related asset</li>
<li>Used to:<ul>
<li>Recognize that depreciation is an estimate</li>
<li>Preserve original cost of asset</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With asset account, they show<ul>
<li>How much of an asset has allocated as an expense</li>
<li>Balance left for depreciation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>^^<strong>EXAMPLES: Slide 60-64</strong>^^</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accrued Expenses<ul>
<li>Incurred but unrecorded expenses</li>
<li>At the end of accounting period is recorded in Expense Account and corresponding Liability Account</li>
<li>As expenses and liabilities accumulate, they <strong>accrue</strong></li>
<li>Common <strong>accrued</strong> expenses<ul>
<li>Interest</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
<li>Wages</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accrued Wages<ul>
<li>The pay period for the secretary at Joan Miller Advertising Agency is biweekly (every two weeks)</li>
<li>The last pay period ended July 26</li>
<li>At the end of business on July 31, the secretary has earned 3 days wages but will not be paid until the next
payday in August</li>
<li>These wages are an expense for July and should be recorded as a liability to the company </li>
<li>Calculating Accrued Wages<ul>
<li>$1200 every two weeks</li>
<li>$1200 divided by 10 business days = $120</li>
<li>Wages Payable for July = $120 times 3 days = $360</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>^^<strong>EXAMPLE: Slide 68-75</strong>^^</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusted Trial Balance<ul>
<li>A trial balance prepared after all adjusting entries have been recorded and posted to accounts<ul>
<li>Total Debits = Total Credits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The financial statements can easily be prepared from adjusted trial balance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sequence of Financial Statements</strong><ul>
<li>(1) Income statement<ul>
<li>Uses
revenue and expense accounts from adjusted trial balance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(2) Statement of owner’s equity<ul>
<li>Uses Capital account balance from adjusted trial balance</li>
<li>Uses net income from the income statement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(3) Balance sheet</li>
<li>Uses balance sheet accounts from adjusted trial balance</li>
<li>Uses end of period balance in Capital account from statement of owner’s equity</li>
