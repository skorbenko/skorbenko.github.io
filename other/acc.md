                - Simple-step is simple
                - Multistep  shows the components used in deriving net income
- L6: Measuring Business Income
    - Profitability
        - is the ability to earn enough income to attract and hold investment capital
        - Accountants use the term **net income**, not __profit__
        - Net Income = Revenues - Expenses
            - is the increase in owner's equity that results from the operations of a company
        - Revenues
            - Increases in owner's equity resulting from
                - Selling goods
                - Rendering services
            - Not all increases in equity arise from revenues
                - Increases from owner's investments do not represent revenue
            - When a company earns revenue, it usually receives cash or a promise to be paid (Accounts Receivable or Notes Receivable)
            - Liabilities are not affected by revenues
            - Transactions increase cash or assets **but** are not revenues
                - A bank loan: increases liabilties and cash
                - Collection of accounts receivable: increases cash and decreases accounts receivable
        - Expenses
            - Decreases in owner's equity resulting from costs
                - Selling goods
                - Rendering services
                - Also called the cost of doing business
            - Transactions that decrease cash and other assets but are not expenses
                - Cash payments to reduce liabilities: decrease cash and decrease liabilities
                - Owner withdrawals
                    - Decrease cash and decrease owner's equity
        - Prepaid Expenses and Plant Assets
            - Two steps before an expenditure of cash becomes an expense
                - Prepaid expenses and plant asseys are recorded as assets when acquired
                - Cost allocated to expenses as usefulness expires
                - Expenses are also called expired costs
                - 
    - Income Measurement Issues
        - Accounting period issue (Periodicity)
            - Concerns the difficulty of assigning revenues and expenses to a short period of time
            - Problem: some transactions have effects over long periods of time
            - Solution: make an assumption about periodicty
            - Accounting Period
                - A specific length of time during which results of transactions are recorded & measured
                - Time periods of equal length
                - Financial statements may be prepared for any time period
                - **Fiscal year**
                    - Twelve-month accounting period used by orgs
                    - Should always be noted in the financial statements
                    - Business can use calendar year or the annual business cycle
                - Interim period
                    - Accounting of less than a year
                    - A month or a quarter
        - Continuity issue
            - Difficulty of knowing how long a business wil survive
            - Problem: certain revenue and expense transactions must be allocated over several accounting periods; uncertainty over the future
            - Solution: accountant assumes that the business operates indefinitely
            - Assumption of Continuity
                - Cost of assets can be held until a future year when they will becom expenses
                - Value of assets is recorded at cost and does not change
                    - When facing bankruptcy, there is no assumption of continuity: assets may be reported at liquidation value
        - Matching issue
            - Problem: Revenues can be earned in a period other than the one in which cash is received; expenses can be incurred in a period other than the one in which cash is paid.
            - Solution: Assign revenues to accounting period in which goods are sold or services are rendered; assign expenses to the period when they are used to produce income.
    - Accrual Accounting
        - is the attempt to record financial effects of transactions in the periods in which they occur rather than when cash is received or paid
        - Revenue Recognition
            - The process of determining when revenue is earned and when it should be recorded
            - Four criteria for revenue recognition
                - Persuasive evidence of an agreement
                - Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered
                - The seller's price to the buyer is fiexed or determinable
                - Reasonable assurance that amount is collectable
        - Expense Recognition
            - Same criteria as for revenue recognition
            - Criteria for recognizing expenses
                - An agreement exists to purchase a product or service
                - The product has been delivered or services rendered
                - A price is established or can be determined
                - The product has been used to produce revenue
        - Adjusting the Accounts
            - Operating a business is a continuous process, but there must be a cutoff point for periodic reports
                - Reports are prepared at the end of accounting period
                    - Balance sheet must list all assets and liabilities at the end
                    - Income statement must list all revenues and expenses of accounting period
                - Some transactions span more than one accounting period; these transactions require adjustments
            - Accrual Accounting and Performance Measures
                - Importance of adjustments
                    - Necessary for determining key profitability performance measures because affects:
                    - Net income on the income statement
                        - Profitability comparisons of different period
                    - Assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
                        - Provide information about a companyâ€™s future cash inflows and outflows
                        - Information needed to assess managementâ€™s short-term goal of liquidity so that there is enough cash to pay bills
                - Adjusting Entries
                    - Never after the Cash account
                    - -- never affect cash flows after the current period, but provides information about future cash flows
                        - Accounts Receivable: expected future cash inflows
                        - Accounts Payable: expected future cash outflows
                    - Considerable judgement in adjusting entries -- potential for abuse; misuse can result in misleading performance measures
                - Adjustmentâ€™s Effect on the Income Statement and Balance Sheet ^^**Slide 34**^^
        - Adjustment Process
            - Adjusting Entries are used to apply accrual accounting to transactions that span more than one accounting period
            - Each adjusting entry must include at least:
                - 1 balance sheet account
                - 1 income statement account
                - No Cash account
            - Adjusting entries are required when
                - Recorded costs are allocated between two or more accounting periods
                - Expenses are incurred but not recorded
                - Recorded but unearned revenues are allocated between two or more accounting periods
                - Revenues are earned but not recorded
            - Four Types of Adjustments ^^**Slide 39**^^
                - Deferred Expenses -- recorded costs are allocated between two or more accounting periods
                - Accrued Expenses -- expenses are incurred but not recorded
                - Accrued Revenues -- revenues are earned but not recorded
                - Deferred Revenues -- revenues are recorded but unearned and two or more accounting periods
            - Deferrals -- postponements of either
                - A recognition of a revenue paid in advance (type 3)
                - A recognition of a paid expense (type 1)
            - Accruals
                - An expense that happened but has not yet been recorded (type 2)
                    - Cash will be paid in future
                - A revenue that happened but has not been recorded (type 4)
                    - Cash will be received in future
            - Deferred Expenses
                - Postponement of recognition of expenses already paid
                - Require allocating recorded costs between two or more periods
                    - Recorded costs
                        - Expenditures of >1 accounting period
                        - Debited to asset account
                        - End of accounting period the used amount will be transferred to expense account
                            - Prepaid expenses and depreciation of
plant and equipment are two types of adjustments involving deferred expenses
            - Prepaid Expenses
                - Expenses paid in advance but that have not expired are recorded as assets
                - A certain portion expires at the end of accounting period
                - Adjusting entry reduces assets and increases expense
                    - Amount of adjustment is the cost of goods/services that are used up/expired
                    - If adjustments of prepaid expenses are not made,
                        - Assets will be overstated
                        - Expenses will be understated
                        - Equity will be overstated
                        - Net income will be overstated
            - ^^**EXAMPLES: Slide 48-56**^^
            - Depreciation
                - is the periodic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its estimated useful life
                    - Purchase of Long-term asset = company is paying in advance for the usefulness of asset for as long as it benefits the company
                    - Purchase of an asset is a deferral of an expense; Cost of asset is allocated over its useful life
                    - The amount allocated to any one period is called __depreciation__, or __depreciation expense__
                - is an expense that is incurred to produce revenue; it must be estimated:
                    - Useful life of asset is estimated
                    - Cost and useful life used to determine the amount expensed each month
                    - A number of methods exist for this
                - Depreciation expense does not reduce the asset account directly; is recorded in a __contra account__
            - Contra account
                - A separate account paired with asset account
                - Used to show the accumulated amount of depreciation expensed for the asset
                - Balance in contra account is show on financial statements as a deduction from related asset
                - Used to:
                    - Recognize that depreciation is an estimate
                    - Preserve original cost of asset
                - With asset account, they show
                    - How much of an asset has allocated as an expense
                    - Balance left for depreciation
                - ^^**EXAMPLES: Slide 60-64**^^
            - Accrued Expenses
                - Incurred but unrecorded expenses
                - At the end of accounting period is recorded in Expense Account and corresponding Liability Account
                - As expenses and liabilities accumulate, they __accrue__
                - Common __accrued__ expenses
                    - Interest
                    - Taxes
                    - Wages
                    - Utilities
                - Accrued Wages
                    - The pay period for the secretary at Joan Miller Advertising Agency is biweekly (every two weeks)
                    - The last pay period ended July 26
                    - At the end of business on July 31, the secretary has earned 3 days wages but will not be paid until the next
payday in August
                    - These wages are an expense for July and should be recorded as a liability to the company 
                    - Calculating Accrued Wages
                        - $1200 every two weeks
                        - $1200 divided by 10 business days = $120
                        - Wages Payable for July = $120 times 3 days = $360
