<ul>
<li>Life<ul>
<li>Kirkcaldy&#39;s geographical proximity to Edinburgh, it was a long way culturally, economically and politically from the coffeehouses and conversations of that great city.</li>
<li>It was this combination -- the quality of Simson&#39;s teaching, the power of Newton&#39;s dynamics and the clarity of reasoning to be found in Euclid -- that Adam Smith seems to have found intoxicating</li>
<li>Smith&#39;s Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres are, then, not merely about the tradecraft of effective communication, but about language as a medium of social and intellectual exchange, and as an illustration of the powers and working of the human mind. They are little known today and little studied, and Smith&#39;s own tastes in literature -- for Livy among historians, for Swift among prose stylists, with a rather qualified admiration for Shakespeare -- have struck some people ever since as distinctly idiosynchratic.</li>
<li>Smith later remembered his thirteen years at Glasgow &#39;as by far the most useful, and therefore as by far the happiest and most honurable period of my life&#39;. It is a typically Smithian move to construe happiness in terms of usefulness.</li>
<li>&#39;Poor David Hume is dying very fast, but with great cheerfulness and good humour and with more real resignation to the necessary course of things, than any whining Christian ever died with pretended resignation to the will of God.&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;I have suffered very little pain from my disorder; and ... never suffered a moment&#39;s aatement of my spirits ... I consider, besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities .. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present.</li>
<li>Shelburne said that he owed to a coach journey with SMith in 1761 &#39;the difference between light and darkness through the best part of my life&#39;.</li>
<li>&#39;Though the death of a person in the ninetieth year of her age was no doubt an event most agreaable to the course of nature; and, therefore, to be foreseen and prepared for; yet I must say to you, what I have said to other people, that the final separation from a person who certainly loved me more than any other person ever did or ever will love me; and whom I certainly loved and respected more than I shall ever love or respect any other person, I cannot help feeling, even at this hour, as a very heavy stroke upon me.</li>
<li>Dundas wrote to him with what must have been a very pleasing invitation: &#39;I am glad you have got vacation. Mr Pitt, Mr Greenville and your humble servant are clearly of opinion you cannot spend it so well as here. The weather is fine, my villa at Wimbledon a most comfortable healthy place. You shall have a comfortable room and as the business is much relaxed we shall have time to discuss all your books with you every evening&#39;.</li>
<li>&#39;This disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful, and to despise, or, at least, to neglect persons of poor and mean condition, though necessary both to establish and to maintain the distinction of ranks and the order of society, is, at the same time, the great and most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments.&#39;</li>
<li>Humans do not merely seek praise and shun blame, they seek to be worthy of praise, and not of blame: &#39;Man naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely; naturally dreads, not only to be hated, but to be hateful; or to be that thing which is the natural and proper object of hatred. He desires, not only praise, but praiseworthiness; or to be that thing which, though it should be praide by nobody, is, however, the natural and proper object of praise.&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;The man of system ... is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it&#39;</li>
<li>Smith&#39;s words about the &#39;man of system&#39; might properly be applied to the &#39;enlightened despots&#39; of the time, Frederic the Great of Prussia and Catherine the Great of Russia.</li>
<li>It is striking that despite a gap in age of twelve years -- a gap if anything made greater by Hume&#39;s early-breaking genius -- they seem always to have conversed on equal terms; indeed there are moments when the desire of the sociable Hume for them to meet can almost seem precatory on his cooler and more self-contained friend.</li>
<li>&#39;Happiness consists in tranquility and enjoyment. Without tranquillity there can be no enjoyment; and where there is perfect tranquillity there is scarce any thing which is not capable of amusing.&#39;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thought<ul>
<li>As economics became more scientific, so it became more mathematical; and as it became more mathematical so it became more removed from everyday life, from human institutions and human values, and indeed from the idea of value itself.</li>
<li>Above all, however, Smith&#39;s theory is dynamic, where Bacon&#39;s is static. Despite his claims to have left Aristotle behind, Bacon still thinks of science in terms of essences, rather than of change; he asks what something is, not what it does. Smith, by contrast, is acutely aware of change. And he has a much more supple sense of his intellectual inheritance.</li>
<li>&quot;I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men&quot; - Newton</li>
<li>Smith&#39;s science of man is not merely aware of change, it presupposes it.</li>
<li>Smith recognizes tht human lives offer huge potential for individually advantageous behaviour to have not positive but negative social effects. The question then is not just why individual behaviour benefits the group, as in much evolutionary theory, but how moral norms that can effectively constrain and penalize bad individual behaviour arise at all.</li>
<li>One thing that Smith gets triumphantly, monumentally right, that guarantees his place among the immortals: he sets himself to address the foundational question of how far the pursuit of individual self-interest through cultural and market exchange can yield economic growth and socially beneficial outcomes.</li>
<li>&#39;Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable admnistration of justice; all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things.&#39;</li>
<li>Against the mistake of seeing The Wealth of Nations as his final word.</li>
<li>&#39;How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.&#39;</li>
<li>Smith sees the action of self-love through commerce as itself a civilizing force, which improves habits and channels human energy into sociability, thrift, hard work and investment.</li>
<li>For the modern world of economics -- of rational economic man, general equilibrium theory and the Efficient Market Hypothesis, is one that has borrowed very selectively from Smith.</li>
<li>It was discovered that Pareto optimality was compatible in principle with widely varying distributional outcomes, adn that the relevant equilibria could be reached by making lump-sum transfers between individuals and then allowing them to trade freely.<ul>
<li>First and Second Welfare Theorems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They were able to make their way to an efficient equilibrium even with only a few, ill-informed and incompletely rational participants.</li>
<li>Mainstream economics has also grown in public stature from having three key features less closely connected to its intrinsic merits. The first is that it is often presented as anautonomous realm of public wisdom and social choice.</li>
<li>The second feature is that economics itself is often seen as a putative theory of everything.</li>
<li>Third factor: its forbidding technical demands. These in turn have served to discourage lay scrutiny, endow the discipline as a whole with a certain mystique and promote a culture of academic dispute and intellectual logic-chopping which can impede outside challenge, interdisciplinary research and a more self-conscious awareness of its own assumptions.</li>
<li>Norms are what make that activity possible at all. This is close to Smith&#39;s view, for he specifically identifies the role of norms of fairness and justice in human interactions: &#39;Nature has implanted in the human breast, that consciousness of ill-desert, those terrors of merited punishment which attend upon its violation, as the great safeguards of the association of mankind, to protect the weak, to curb the violent, and to chastise the guilty.&#39;</li>
<li>Commercial society is in certain ways not merely economically but morally superior to the feudalism of medieval Britain.</li>
<li>The effect of the Norman invasion of 1066 was to appropriate all real property in Britain and bring it under the ownership of King William, as catalogued in Doomsday Book; in the feudal system this land was not privately owned, but merely held under a tenurial relationship with the Crown, conditional on payment of tax or a commitment of military service or other work in kind to a superior. This system broke down with the passage of time, but the principle that official records should be kept of property ownership, records which could be used to decide between conflicting claims, did not.</li>
