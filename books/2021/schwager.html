<ul>
<li>Trends<ul>
<li>Thomas DeMark Lines<ul>
<li>DeMark acknowledges that in order for the trendline to be determined accurately and unambiguously, it must be based strictly on two points. DeMark also notes that contrary to usual, the trend line follows draw from right to left, because “recent price action is more importan  than the past movement. &quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moving Averages <ul>
<li>The problem is that if in markets with a pronounced trend moving averages work well, in fluctuating markets where there is no pronounced trend, moving averages give a lot of false signals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trading Ranges<ul>
<li>In general, markets spend most of their time in trading ranges. However, it is unfortunately very difficult to conduct profitable trading in them. In fact, most technical traders will likely find that the best strategy they can apply to trading ranges is to minimize their involvement in such markets, which is easier said than done.</li>
<li>Trading Ranges Breakthrough<ul>
<li>Breakout outside the trading range suggests the upcoming price movement in the direction of the breakout. The significance and reliability of a breakdown is often increased by the following factors:<ul>
<li><strong> Length of the trading range. </strong> The more the length of the trading range, the potentially more the scale of the future breakdown is more significant. This thesis illlustrated by the example of the weekly and daily graphs</li>
<li>Narrowness of the range. Breakouts from narrow ranges, as a rule, provide especially reliable signals to trade. Moreover, such trading can be extremely attractive because reasonable protective stops imply relatively low monetary risk.</li>
<li>Breakout confirmation. It is quite common for prices to break out of the trading range by only a small amount or only for a few days, and then return back into the range. One of the reasons for this is that market participants, wanting to insure against strong price movements after the breakdown of the trading range, place protective stop orders in an area that is not far beyond the trading range. As a consequence, a slight outward price movement can sometimes trigger a significant number of protective orders to be executed. Once this initial influx of orders is satisfied, the breakout dries up unless there are strong fundamentals and supportive buys (or strong sells if the lower boundary is broken) underneath to reinforce the trend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support and Resistance<ul>
<li>Trading ranges<ul>
<li>After prices break out of the trading range, the level that previously served as resistance becomes support, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Previous important MAX and MIN<ul>
<li>A breakout of the previous high can be considered as a buy signal, and a breakdown of the previous low is a signal to sale. However, just as in the case of the breakdown of the boundaries of trading ranges, in order to use the breakout of highs and lows as a as signals to trade, they must meet certain minimum requirements (by the breakdown depth in price terms or by the time duration).</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Rule of 7:<ul>
<li>The Rule of Seven is a system of three SELL offers for a long trade:</li>
<li>MIN+7/4*h</li>
<li>MIN+7/3*h</li>
<li>MIN+7/2*h</li>
<li>where h is RESISTANCE-SUPPORT</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Levels of Support &amp; Resistance<ul>
<li>Are only products of short-term movement</li>

<li>Contrary Opinion<ul>
<li>It is tough to accurately measure market mood</li>

<li>Training stops (see <strong>Pricing Stop-Loss Points</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Most Important Rule of Technical Analysis<ul>
<li>Failed Signal<ul>
<li>When a market cannot move as signalled, it will move the other way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bull Trap<ul>
<li>A significant breakthrough then a sudden turnaround</li>
<li>Confirmation<ul>
<li>Initial price confirmation: return of prices to the middle of the consolidation that was before the breakthrough</li>
<li>Strong price confirmation: return of prices to the lower border of the consolidation</li>
<li>Timely confirmation: when prices cannot move towards an extrema</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not use this when PRICE &gt; MAX</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>False trendline breakthrough<ul>
<li>Often fake</li>
<li>Possible to use as a signal that is opposite of a breakthrough with a stop-loss</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filled gap<ul>
<li>A gap is a signal; a filled gap is not a signal</li>
<li>Significance increases if:<ul>
<li>The gap is wide</li>
<li>More than two consecutive gaps</li>
<li>Gap + line breakthrough</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return to MAX or MIN of spike<ul>
<li>Return to extrema of old spike means that the signal did not work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return to bounds of highly volatile day</li>
<li>Flag/Pennant did not work<ul>
<li>Correction comex next</li>
<li>Not always a fake signal</li>
