<li>In the late 19th century, the coffee trade attracted opportunists as it was highly unsteady</li>
<li>In the 1700s coffee was cultivated only in Yemen and thus controlled by a small quantity of merchants. Today it is actively traded on exchanges as a commodity (there are many producers)</li>
<li>In the 1800s coffee was a luxury for privileged classes. It was most often drank in coffeehouses: centers of ideas, art, politics, culture, so on. Today everyone drinks it; it is a drug for productivity used by the masses.</li>
<li>The efforts to educate Western consumers about the consequences of low coffee prices &amp; the general conditions on coffee plantations began in the XX century.</li>
<li>Today coffee is the leading fair trade product, and is most often used in economics textbooks to provide an example for world trade. </li>
<li>Between 1850 and 1914, world trade increased x11; the gap between industrial economies and agricultural economies widened: the world has become divided into the coffee drinker and the coffee worker.</li>
<li>In 1554, Schems and Hekim open what is considered the first coffeeshop ever in Constantinople. It was furnished with Syrian couches and carpets, and was a highly valued social place. Many patrons were “studious Persons”. </li>
<li>Coffee has entered into the world record at the very start of the XVI century.</li>
<li>The first commercial harvests of coffee were gathered in Ethiopia from wild plants in the XV century.</li>
<li>The first commercial cultivation of coffee took place in XVI century Yemen, and consumption spread in the Arabian Peninsula and all through the Mediterranean.</li>
<li>Ottoman emperors often build a coffeehouse firstly when conquering a new city, thus demonstrating their civil intentions.</li>
<li>The word “coffee” is thought to derive from the Arabic ganwah: wine. Coffee was “the wine of Islam”</li>
<li>When it first came to Britain, coffee was called the “Turkes berry drinke”</li>
<li>London’s first coffeehouse opened in the early 1650s. It was bankrolled by the Levant Company. Its agents traded coffee, spices, wool, tin, gunpowder.</li>
<li>Many coffeeshops in London were more than stalls; they were penny [the price of a single coffee] universities, forums for discussion of news and ideas, etc.</li>
<li>“Visiting London coffeehouses in 1660, diarist Samuel Pepys recorded talk of the weather, the sex lives of insects, and the proper distribution of wealth.”</li>
<li>June 1699: John Houghton gave a “Discourse on Coffee” at the Grecian coffeehouse. He noted that coffee made “all sorts of people sociable” and “improved useful knowledge very much”</li>
<li>The name “Coffee arabica” derives from the fact that traders of coffee in the XVI and XVII centuries were mainly Arabs.</li>
<li>The British began cultivating coffee in Jamaica by 1730; the Spanish were late to the trade and began cultivating coffee in Cuba in 1748. This was because Spanish preferred cacao.</li>
<li>In the late 18th century, coffee prices rose; there was large incentive for innovation both in the workforce and in the exporter countries</li>
<li>“Hills Bros. Arabian Coffee &amp; Spice Mills” one of the first significantly interesting Californian coffeeshops, not least because of its closeness to the ports, and thus, ability to pressure the planters.</li>
<li>In the late 18th century, Thomas Jefferson wrote that “It [coffee] will be a strong link of connection with the only nation on earth on whom we can solidly rely”. Thus, coffee became politically important.</li>
<li>In the 1780s, American coastal cities have took to European coffee culture</li>
<li>“We are perfectly reconciled to this American custom of drinking coffee.” wrote a French traveler to Virginia in 1787. Outside the elite, coffee was still too expensive to be a custom.</li>
<li>American consumption of coffee increased significantly after the Civil War: troops have grown accustomed to it.</li>
<li>Duping was very common at all stages of the coffee trade in the US al through the 18th century. The taste of all coffee was so mediocre that mostly no-one could tell the difference between various beans.</li>
<li>Victorians glorified work as a “supreme virtue”, almost as the meaning of life. </li>
<li>The New York Coffee Exchange opened in 1882 and became the first coffee exchange in the world. The 2nd coffee exchange opened in Le Havre (the greatest port for coffee). This once again proved the connection between the US and France. </li>
<li>Episodes of coffee-drinkers:<ul>
<li>He saw the boy bootblacks who inhabited the crowded dormitories of the Newsboys’ Lodging House on Duane Street spending six cents on a bunk for the night and six cents on bread and coffee for breakfast.</li>
<li>He noticed men and boys of all ages crowded around one-cent coffee stalls on the street.</li>
<li>He met one young and pretty Broadway seamstress, whose case he took to be representative of many more, who, without a spare cent, took a cup of coffee at breakfast, no lunch, and her one meal of the day for dinner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As demand for coffee rose in the US, the supply of coffee grew in Brazil like a lagging indicator. This led to a price collapse when??</li>
<li>More Italians arrived in Brazil between 1888 and 1900 than to the US</li>
<li>With the defeat of Spain, the US in 1898 became not only the largest consumer of coffee (and one without an import duty at that) but also a coffee producer through its colonies.</li>
<li>Puerto Rican planters raised under the Spaniards considered empire as protection.</li>
<li>Evaluating coffee by its appearance saved importers time and money; evaluating coffee by taste (cupping) benefits the consumer.</li>
<li>At the end of the XIX century, the Hills Bros company began evaluating coffee “in the cup”</li>
<li>At the end of the XIX century, “Brazils” were considered low-quality coffees vs the “milds”. “Milds” were sweet in the cup and had a finer aroma, distinctive characteristics.</li>
<li>Bourbon coffee was brought to Guatemala by priests and was grown in Brazil. One could get two or three times as much coffee from a Bourbon tree as from a standard Arabica tree. The Bourbon trees were also hardier. Thus more Salvadorian land became open to coffee planting. In the end, one could raise trees en masse in a district synonymous with quality.</li>
<li>Soluble coffee manufactured on the model of Japanese soluble tea had made its public debut at the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition in 1901</li>
<li>A company used the very best coffee and cream for an organized “coffee break”. This lead to a more consistent standard of quality in the product. Even the corporate treasurer argued that it is critical only the <em>best</em> coffee be used.<ul>
<li><em>“Just as a question of mechanics, I can&#39;t overestimate the necessity of maintaining quality in the coffee served. To my notion, it is just as foolish to supply the men with a poor coffee as it would be to buy a poor grade of oil for a very delicate machine”</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Then as now, a cup of coffee was not what the poor and the hungry needed most, but it was something they thought they might get. At soup kitchens and in breadlines, hours of waiting would produce a bowl of mush, often without milk or sugar, and a tin cup of coffee.”</li>
