<li>Gorbachev’s mother, Maria, could be cold and punitive: she had resisted being married to her husband, and she disciplined her son with a belt until he was thirteen. The family tensions took a toll on Mikhail; as he grew up, and even after he matured, he seemed to have a special need for the kind of attention and respect that he thought he deserved.</li>

<li>By 1950, when Gorbachev left Privolnoe to attend Moscow State University, he was strong, independent-minded and self-confident to the point of arrogance.</li>

<li>Sergei Gorbachev “was a wise man,” recalled a contemporary, “modest but extremely hardworking. . . . People loved him. He was always calm, a good man. People went to him for advice. He didn’t say much, but he weighed every word. He didn’t like speechifying.”26 According to a Komsomol colleague of Mikhail’s, the elder Gorbachev “never raised his voice, was levelheaded, orderly, and decent.”27 Raisa Gorbachev remembered, “Mikhail Sergeyevich and his father were very much alike. They were friends. Sergei Andreyevich never got a systematic education, but he had a natural cultivation, a sort of nobility, a certain breadth of interests.”</li>

<li>“She never could forgive me for the way I defended my father. ‘Your father is your favorite,’ she would say to me. I’d say, ‘You’re my favorite, too, but you haven’t noticed that I’ve grown up.’” -- Gorbachev, talking of his mother</li>

<li>He looked at me again and said something that I’ve remembered my whole life: ‘We fought until we ran out of fight,’ he said. ‘That’s how you must live.’” Sergei Gorbachev, Mikhail's father, giving him life advice after returning from World War II</li>

<li>Do such experiences [experiences of the war] help explain Gorbachev’s extraordinary reluctance, once he became supreme Soviet leader, to use force and violence to preserve the Soviet empire? Perhaps because that reluctance, so admired in the West, is as strongly condemned in Russia, he declined in an interview to answer the question.</li>

<li>Gorbachev began to identify success in life with reading and thinking, and also with leading his peers. [after returning from his first day at school]</li>

<li>From Belinsky, Gorbachev moved on to Pushkin, Gogol, and especially Lermontov. That early nineteenth-century poet of the Caucasus died young in a duel in Piatigorsk, approximately 120 miles from Privolnoe. Lermontov’s romanticism captivated him; “I knew not only his short poems but his long ones by heart.” Next, he was fascinated by Mayakovsky—more poetry full of romantic love, erotic longing, and rebelliousness. “What struck me then, and still strikes me now, was how these young writers managed to lift themselves to a level where they made philosophical generalizations. That was a gift of God!”</li>

<li>Gorbachev had extremely high standards for everyone. “I felt I was really not good enough for him,” Yulia [Mikhail's high school girlfriend] recalled, “or we really didn’t fit. He was too energetic, too serious, so organized. And he was smarter than I was. He was the center of attention.”</li>

<li>“I know for a fact,” says Zoya Bekova, “that he never stopped until two or three in the morning, after getting up at 5 or 6 a.m. He studied, he read, he did everything he could to bring himself up to the level of the Muscovites.</li>

<li>Gorbachev himself puts it this way, “I had made a firm decision—I would devote all five years at MGU to study. No love affairs.”</li>

<li>“He was not the most impressive student in our class by any means,” said Rudolf Kolchanov. “It’s not as if he were always a great reformer and world leader just waiting to happen.”43 Natalia Rimashevskaya, later a distinguished sociologist, remembered that Gorbachev “never tried to stand out, but rather stayed in the shadows. In class, he used to sit in the next to last row of seats. Those who wanted to be known as leaders made sure they occupied center seats in the first row.</li>

<li>It took him five years of living in Moscow to discover that “if you want to understand the inner world of the Soviet people, it is far more important to read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, and Gogol than all the literary productions of socialist realism put together.”
“We understood,” he recounts, “that we could not and must not part.”96 “Our relationship and our feeling,” she carefully told an interviewer in 1990, “were . . . perceived by us as a natural, inseparable part of our fate.          </li>

<li>Gorbachev got angry: “Mama, I’m going to tell you something you better remember: I love her. She’s my wife. And I never want to hear anything like that from you ever again.”</li>

<li>But over the next twelve years he rose steadily, first in the Komsomol and then in the Communist party apparatus itself: 1957—in charge of the Stavropol city Komsomol; 1958—number two man in the regional Komsomol and in 1961 its leader; 1962—party boss of a rural district; 1963—supervising appointments to all party posts in the Stavropol region; 1966—Stavropol city party chief; 1968—deputy party boss of the whole Stavropol region.</li>

<li>He had stood out in elementary and high school and at Moscow University, but his Stavropol experience further heightened his self-confidence. Comparing himself with the Komsomol propagandists he supervised in 1955, he could tell he was “so to speak, a head higher than they were.” His university education gave him “indisputable advantages.”               </li>

<li>He had to learn “to use the [debating] power I had very carefully.”                </li>

<li>Gorbachev admitted in his memoirs that the pressure of work, especially the bombardment of instructions from the Komsomol Central Committee in Moscow, was wearing. It was as if “those at the top were firmly convinced that without their bureaucratic directives no grass could grow and no cows could calve, as if the economy could function only under a regime of ‘permanent mobilization,’ completely deprived of any capacity for self-development.” But that didn’t prevent him from projecting during these years the image of a man fully in control of himself, his job, and his future.</li>

<li>His closest adviser, said Bazikova, was his wife. They were wonderfully “open and sincere” with each other. She was “very smart,” and he “knew that and listened to her. He didn’t trust many party workers, but he did trust her—in everything.” Even when the advice she gave him wasn’t good, at least it was “sincere.”</li>

<li>Kulakov would never forgive him. “The very best speech,” he continued, “is the one that goes ungiven.” Excellent advice! Gorbachev didn’t follow it often enough when he was Soviet leader.</li>

<li>tensions developed between the two men. It may be that Yefremov, with his cultural and intellectual pretensions, felt more challenged by Gorbachev than Kulakov had. Or that since his own career was declining, he resented a hotshot on the rise. Gorbachev probably also saw Yefremov as a loser who couldn’t help him advance his career.</li>

<li>“The supercentralized attempt to control every single detail of life in an immense state sapped the vital energies of society.”22 Much later, after he became Soviet leader, Gorbachev would dig deeper still, tracing the problems he saw in Stavropol to the very essence of Soviet state socialism, that is, to the Communist party’s monopoly of political and economic power.              </li>

<li>Gorbachev had no hobbies, Mikhailenko added; his favorite leisure-time activity was taking long nature walks with his wife.</li>

<li>Andropov didn’t hold Gorbachev’s cheekiness against him. He countered that both older and younger leaders were needed, the elders guarding against the young men’s careerism, the young pushing their elders to work harder and better. Several years later, after Gorbachev had been promoted to Central Committee secretary in Moscow, Andropov greeted him with a smile: “Congratulations, Mr. Undergrowth. Now you’re part of the forest.”</li>

<li>Another liberal-minded Andropov adviser, economist Oleg Bogomolov, recalled seeing copies of books by Montaigne and Machiavelli on Andropov’s desk in the 1960s. “Why are you reading those books?” Bogomolov asked. “So as to be able to speak with you and your colleagues as equals,” Andropov replied.</li>

<li>[Andropov] didn’t smoke, and limited his alcohol intake. Both men knew how to make others feel comfortable in their presence. Both could carry a tune and each tried to write his own speeches, or at least rewrote draft after draft. (Andropov actually wrote poetry as well.) Neither knew enough about economics.71 It’s not surprising, then, that Andropov took a liking to Gorbachev, such a strong one that in the spring of 1977, he singled him out, in a conversation with Arbatov, as the kind of young leader who represented the hope of the nation.</li>

<li>Andropov developed what Arbatov and Soviet dissident historian Roy Medvedev called a “Hungarian complex,” namely, the fear that attempts to reform “from below” were fated to morph into mob rule (the same sort of complex, one might add, that seemed to animate Russian President Vladimir Putin half a century later).</li>

<li>In retrospect, it’s clear he [Gorbachev] was playing the game in order to change it. Ironically, though, he was better at old-style Kremlin infighting than at the new game of open, mass politics that he himself would later introduce.</li>

<li>Yakovlev mostly kept to himself, concentrating on his research on FDR and the New Deal, attending classes on American history and politics taught by distinguished scholars Richard Hofstadter and David B. Truman, even sitting in on Alexander Dallin’s course on Soviet foreign policy. The one American graduate student with whom he became friendly was Loren R. Graham, later to become a leading historian of Soviet science and technology. Once, when the two encountered each other in Butler Library stacks, Yakovlev exclaimed, “Loren, I’ve been reading FDR’s right-wing critics. They all said that Roosevelt was a traitor to his class, that he was destroying capitalism in America. But it’s obvious to me that Roosevelt was not destroying capitalism at all. He was saving capitalism when it was on its knees.” At the height of perestroika, Graham asked Yakovlev if he and Gorbachev were “trying to save communism the way Roosevelt saved capitalism.” Yakovlev smiled: “Yes, you are right.”</li>

<li>He stunned his hosts [the Thatchers] by quoting Victorian British statesman Lord Palmerston’s famous dictum, clearly at odds with official Soviet ideology, that, in Mrs. Thatcher’s words, Britain had “no eternal friends or eternal enemies, but only eternal interests.” </li>
