<li>Gorbachev’s mother, Maria, could be cold and punitive: she had resisted being married to her husband, and she disciplined her son with a belt until he was thirteen. The family tensions took a toll on Mikhail; as he grew up, and even after he matured, he seemed to have a special need for the kind of attention and respect that he thought he deserved.</li>

<li>By 1950, when Gorbachev left Privolnoe to attend Moscow State University, he was strong, independent-minded and self-confident to the point of arrogance.</li>

<li>Sergei Gorbachev “was a wise man,” recalled a contemporary, “modest but extremely hardworking. . . . People loved him. He was always calm, a good man. People went to him for advice. He didn’t say much, but he weighed every word. He didn’t like speechifying.”26 According to a Komsomol colleague of Mikhail’s, the elder Gorbachev “never raised his voice, was levelheaded, orderly, and decent.”27 Raisa Gorbachev remembered, “Mikhail Sergeyevich and his father were very much alike. They were friends. Sergei Andreyevich never got a systematic education, but he had a natural cultivation, a sort of nobility, a certain breadth of interests.”</li>

<li>“She never could forgive me for the way I defended my father. ‘Your father is your favorite,’ she would say to me. I’d say, ‘You’re my favorite, too, but you haven’t noticed that I’ve grown up.’” -- Gorbachev, talking of his mother </li>

<li>He looked at me again and said something that I’ve remembered my whole life: ‘We fought until we ran out of fight,’ he said. ‘That’s how you must live.’” Sergei Gorbachev, Mikhail's father, giving him life advice after returning from World War II</li>

<li>Do such experiences [experiences of the war] help explain Gorbachev’s extraordinary reluctance, once he became supreme Soviet leader, to use force and violence to preserve the Soviet empire? Perhaps because that reluctance, so admired in the West, is as strongly condemned in Russia, he declined in an interview to answer the question. </li>

<li>Gorbachev began to identify success in life with reading and thinking, and also with leading his peers. [after returning from his first day at school]</li>

<li>From Belinsky, Gorbachev moved on to Pushkin, Gogol, and especially Lermontov. That early nineteenth-century poet of the Caucasus died young in a duel in Piatigorsk, approximately 120 miles from Privolnoe. Lermontov’s romanticism captivated him; “I knew not only his short poems but his long ones by heart.” Next, he was fascinated by Mayakovsky—more poetry full of romantic love, erotic longing, and rebelliousness. “What struck me then, and still strikes me now, was how these young writers managed to lift themselves to a level where they made philosophical generalizations. That was a gift of God!”</li>

<li>Gorbachev had extremely high standards for everyone. “I felt I was really not good enough for him,” Yulia [Mikhail's high school girlfriend] recalled, “or we really didn’t fit. He was too energetic, too serious, so organized. And he was smarter than I was. He was the center of attention.”</li>
