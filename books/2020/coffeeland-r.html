<p>The problem with Coffeeland lies in its subtitle: "One Man's Dark Empire and the Making of Our Favourite Drug". The tome explores One Man's Empire, that is true; it does not indicate  why the Empire should be considered "Dark". Nonetheless, the tome provides an inadequate review of the Making of Our Favourite Drug, as it follows mostly one man, James Hill, and goes onto different (highly interesting yet only somewhat related) tangents, such as the birth of Communism in Latin America and thermodynamics.</p>
<p>To say that the book is fundamentally flawed or not worth reading would be a mistake, but to get an account of the Making of Our Favourite Drug, and a classic one at that, one is better suited to look to All About Coffee by William H. Ukers.</p>
