	<li>"This is where you can help, if you would" -- from a letter from Bernstein to Aaron Copland, one of his mentors</li>
	<li>"I thoroughly disapprove of Mr. Bernstein's arrogant attitude and the air of superiority achieved by him. His otherwise interesting analysis of the modernistic idiom would have gained much without this display of immature, juvenile and unjust criticism. With this reservation I accept his thesis for honors, but would like to see that my objections are made known to him" Hugo Leichtentritt, a Harvard musicologist, on Bernstein's thesis</li>
	<li>Mitropoulos offered the assistance Bernstein needed -- seventy-five dollars a month. Bernstein never forgot this characteristic act of generosity, and thereafter ascribed to Mitropoulos a more central role in determining his career than was perhaps merited by facts.</li>
	<li>"I work and work and work (practice about 3 to 5 hrs. a day), and do nothing else, except sleep plenty. No social life -- no friend to speak of." -- Bernstein's letter to Helen Coates in 1940, from the Curtis Institute in Pennsylvania </li>
	<li>"So long as art and culture exist there is hope for humanity" -- Serge Koussevitzky</li>
</ul>
