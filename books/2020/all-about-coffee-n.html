<li>Arab physicians prescribed the coffee as a drug, thus creating a myth of its powerful effects rather than a simple beverage</li>

<li>The inhabitants of Mecca disregarded coffee’s religious associations and made it a secular and enjoyable drink.</li>

<li>“Kaveh kanes” were the first coffee houses. The idle drank coffee, played chess, discussed the news, sang, danced.</li>

<li>Coffee met no opposition in Mecca until 1524, when the kadi closed the coffee houses but did not interfere with coffee in home and in private. His successor reopened the coffee houses.</li>

<li>“One of the most interesting facts in the history of the coffee drink is that wherever it has been introduced it has spelled revolution. It has been the world’s most radical drink in that its function has always been to make people think. And when the people began to think, they became dangerous to tyrants and to foes of liberty of thought and action.”</li>

<li>Coffee was known in Constantinople since 1517. Coffee houses appeared in 1554.</li>

<li>“Coffee joins men, born for society, in a more perfect union; protestations are more sincere in being made at a time when the mind is not clouded with fumes and vapors, and therefore not easily forgotten, which too frequently happens when made over a bottle."</li>

<li>Refusal to give coffee to wives was a legitimate cause for divorce among Turks. The men made promise when marrying never to let their wives be without coffee.</li>

<li>In Constantinople, coffee was the main pastime among Turks. People of distinction had a special room for coffee</li>

<li>Italy created the first real coffee house; France &amp; Austria improved it</li>

<li>His domicile was the residence of his wife and the repository of his possessions; but only on exceptional occasions was it the scene of domestic hospitality, and rare were the instances when the husband and wife might be seen abroad together, and when the former would invite the lady to enter a café or a confectioner's shop to partake of an ice.</li>

<li>“Loquendum est cum vulgo, sentiendum cum sapientibus"</li>

<li>It is easy to see why the coffee houses at once found favor among men of intelligence in all classes. Until they came, the average Englishman had only the tavern as a place of common resort. But here was a public house offering a non-intoxicating beverage, and its appeal was instant</li>

<li>Coffeehouses were sometimes called “Penny Universities"</li>

<li>There hung brass-bound boxes into which customers were expected to drop coins for the servants. The boxes were inscribed "To Insure Promptness" and from the initial letters of these words came "tip."</li>

<li>Rich merchants alone ventured to enter certain of the coffee houses, where they transacted business more privately and more expeditiously than on the Exchange.</li>

<li>Undoubtedly the first to bring a knowledge of coffee to North America was Captain John Smith, who founded the Colony of Virginia at Jamestown in 1607. Captain Smith became familiar with coffee in his travels in Turkey.</li>

<li>“Everything that is agreeable to him, and accordingly waited on him to the coffee-house, where his venerable figure drew upon us the eyes of the whole room. He had no sooner seated himself at the upper end of the high table, but he called for a clean pipe, a paper of tobacco, a dish of coffee, a wax candle and the 'Supplement' (a periodical paper of that time), with such an air of cheerfulness and good humour, that all the boys in the coffee room (who seemed to take pleasure in serving him) were at once employed on his several errands, insomuch that nobody else could come at a dish of tea until the Knight had got all his conveniences about him.”</li>
